So let\\'s discuss what is the brute force.\\n\\nA Brute force is a force which is applied brutally , Joking guys. \\n\\nLet\\'s see \\nSo I need all substring which are palindrome, and I know that every substring will have one start index and one end index. So we can have two loops first is for starting index and second is for end index. And now what I can do is, I can check if that substring is palindrome or not.\\n\\nLet\\'s code it also ( Although Interviewer don\\'t want this , Because you have to ask him if he want more optimised version )\\nJava []\\nclass Solution {\\n\\n    public boolean isPalindrome(String s, int left, int right) {\\n        while(left \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWtf ? Our Brute Force worked.\\n\\n\\nInterviewer: What would be the time and space complexity here ?\\nYou: Time Complexity would be $$O(n^3)$$. Because we have two for loops to iterate all possible substring and one loop to check if it is palindrome or not.\\nSpace Complexity would be $$O(1)$$.\\n\\nInterviewer: Cany you optimise it further ?\\nYou: Sure ( MF ).\\n\\nSo Basically If I know a string is palindrome and I divide it in two parts ( if length is even ) that would have same characters.\\nand for odd length except the middle element, all other characters would be same.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo If I pick a character and expand it\\'s left and right side till I have similiar elements. Those would be palindrome. But this could be even length palindrome\\'s middle or odd length palindrome\\'s middle. So we will take care of both case.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf it is odd, expand left = (i-1) and right = (i+1)\\nIf it is even, expand left = (i) and right = (i+1)\\n\\nWe have to do this for each character to explore all substrings.\\n\\nInterviewer : Approach seems good to me. Let\\'s discuss Time and Space Complexity then we can proceed for the code part.\\nYou : Sure , Here Time Complexity would be O(n^2) because for a character worst case can be to traverse all neighbours. \\nand Space Complexity would be O(1).\\n\\nNow let\\'s code it\\nJava []\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int countSubstrings(String s) {\\n        int n = s.length();\\n        int ans = 0;\\n        for(int i=0;i= 0 && right \\nC++ []\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int countSubstrings(string s) {\\n        int n = s.length(), ans = 0;\\n        for (int i = 0; i = 0 && right \\nPython []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def countSubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:\\n        n, ans = len(s), 0\\n        \\n        def palindromeCount(left: int, right: int) -> int:\\n            count = 0\\n            while left >= 0 and right \\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve another approach for DP lovers. ( Let me know in comment section if you are )\\n\\n# Another Approach ( Using DP )\\n### What about the length 1 ?\\nYes, It will always be palindrome.\\n\\n### and What about length 2 ?\\nIt would be palindrome if only both are same.\\n\\n\\n\\nnow let\\'s say I have one string f(a, b) = \"nitin\"\\nand I know that f(a+1, b-1) is palindrome, then if the boundary characters are same I can say that this is palindrome.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere we can say that if I know the answer for length 1, I can build the answer for length 3, how ?\\nSo basically  I just need to check boundary elements and middle one I already know if it palindrome or not.\\n\\nSo we will try to build from length 1 to n one by one and count the number of palindrome.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: $$O(n^2)$$\\n\\n\\n- Space complexity: $$O(n^2)$$\\n\\n\\n# Code\\njava []\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int countSubstrings(String s) {\\n        int n = s.length();\\n        boolean[][] palindrome = new boolean[n][n];\\n        int ans = 0;\\n\\n        for(int i=0;i\\nC++ []\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int countSubstrings(string s) {\\n        int n = s.length();\\n        vector> palindrome(n, vector(n, false));\\n        int ans = 0;\\n\\n        for (int i = 0; i \\nPython []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def countSubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:\\n        n = len(s)\\n        palindrome = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]\\n        ans = 0\\n\\n        for i in range(n):\\n            palindrome[i][i] = True\\n            ans += 1\\n\\n        for i in range(n - 1):\\n            if s[i] == s[i + 1]:\\n                palindrome[i][i + 1] = True\\n                ans += 1\\n\\n        for length in range(3, n + 1):\\n            for i in range(n - length + 1):\\n                if s[i] == s[i + length - 1] and palindrome[i + 1][i + length - 2]:\\n                    palindrome[i][i + length - 1] = True\\n                    ans += 1\\n\\n        return ans\\n\\nJavaScript []\\n/**\\n * @param {string} s\\n * @return {number}\\n */\\nvar countSubstrings = function(s) {\\n    const n = s.length;\\n    const palindrome = Array.from(Array(n), () => Array(n).fill(false));\\n    let ans = 0;\\n\\n    for (let i = 0; i \\n\\nNow do you guys know who we are ?

It got TLE.\\nInterviewer: LOL !\\nYou : I know you know it would get TLE ( MF )\\nInterviewer : Can you optimise it ?\\nYou : Sure ( MF )\\n\\nSo here we can see that ( Remember that whenever you have recursion with more than 1 recursive function in it, It\\'s always possible that some of the recursive function we are re-calculating )\\n\\n\\n\\nHere in above diagram you can clearly see, [2,3] already calculated when I was on [1,3] and it will be calculating again from [1,4] so I will store my result in an array.\\n\\nNow here we have 3 things that are changing,\\n1. current row\\n2. robotA col\\n3. robotB col\\nSo we will use 3D array to store our result.\\n\\nSo let\\'s code\\n\\n\\n# Code\\nJava []\\nclass Solution {\\n    \\n    Integer memo[][][];\\n    \\n    public int cherryPickup(int[][] grid) {\\n        int rows = grid.length;\\n        int cols = grid[0].length;\\n        memo = new Integer[rows+1][cols+1][cols+1];\\n        return helper(grid, 0, 0, cols-1);\\n    }\\n    \\n    public int helper(int[][] grid, int currRow, int robotACol, int robotBCol) {\\n        \\n        if(robotACol = grid[0].length || robotBCol >= grid[0].length) return 0;\\n        \\n        if(currRow == grid.length) return 0;\\n        \\n        if(memo[currRow][robotACol][robotBCol] != null)\\n            return memo[currRow][robotACol][robotBCol];\\n        \\n        int result = 0;\\n        result += grid[currRow][robotACol];\\n        result += grid[currRow][robotBCol];\\n        \\n        int max = 0;\\n        for(int x=robotACol-1;x\\n\\nAnd it got passed.\\nInterviewer : Can we discuss time and space complexity for this approach.\\nYou : Sure, so space complexity would be O(m*n^2) for memoization. where m is row and n is col.

( Thinking .. ) As of now I am not able to think of any approach which can have better time complexity than this.\\nInterviwer : Ok, What about space ?\\nYou : Space Complexity. Yes yes I got it. ( Because MF I already knew you would ask me this question. ) As we can see that for any current row we are just dependent on previous row and all other rows are of no use. So we just need two rows.\\nLet\\'s say I can have two array, prev and curr. And every time when I go to new row this curr would become prev.\\nBut I can do this using array of length 2.\\nwhere for previous row, I can do (i+1)%2 means if I am at 0th row my previous would be at 1 and when I am at 1 my previous would be 0.\\nInterviewer : Can you modify you previous approach with this.\\nYou : Sure.\\n\\nJava []\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int cherryPickup(int[][] grid) {\\n        int m = grid.length;\\n        int n = grid[0].length;\\n\\n        int[][][] dp = new int[2][n][n];\\n        int ans = 0;\\n\\n        for(int i=0;i= 0 && j+x = 0 && k+y \\n\\nInterviewer : Ok !

If greedy fails then go for DP.\\n\\nBecause for DP either you might require O(n^2) or \\nsometime for 3D dp O(n^3) time. \\n\\nBut in greedy which mostly work by sorting data it will be \\nin O(n*logn). \\n\\nIf you closely check the input size is 10^5 so for sure \\nwe have to do this in O(nlogn) or lower time.\\n\\n\\nHere it\\'s not like I have choice either I can pick ladder or brick, I also need to make sure I reach the maximum index.\\n\\nSo let\\'s say you have to climb 8 and 2, and you have 5 bricks and 1 ladder.\\n\\nWhat will you do ?\\nObviously you will try to climb the highest using ladder else you will waste too many bricks.\\n\\nConclusion []\\nSo here we know that we will use ladders for the highest \\nclimb and bricks for the remaining.\\n\\n\\nNow here comes the best part \\nHow will you manage this, like for the highest climb you are using ladders and for other you are using bricks.\\n\\n1. First of all as we climb one by one, we will use ladders till we are out of ladders.\\n2. Now when we have consumed our all ladders, now it\\'s our turn to use bricks. Now let\\'s say previously we have use ladders to climb [4, 10, 6] and now we have to climb 5, so now I know that for 5 I should use ladder, and the previously I have used ladder for 4 I will use brick there.\\n3. So now ladders will be used to climb [10, 6, 5] and bricks for [4].\\n4. Now let\\'s say I have to climb 2, then obviously I can\\'t use ladders because they are already being used to climb high. SO I will use bricks here. But let\\'s say I have one 1 brick left then I won\\'t be able to climb further.\\n\\nNow if you have read all 4 points clearly, you got to know that if the climb is lower or equal to the climb made by ladders then we can use brick.\\nbut if we found high climb where previously we have used ladders for the lower climb, I will use ladders here and bricks there.\\n\\nFinal []\\nSo everytime, I am picking up minimum from ladders if it is less \\nor equal to the current climb, I will just use bricks.\\nElse I will remove the minimum and insert new climb in ladders and \\nfor the removed climb ( min. from ladders ) I will use bricks.\\n\\n\\nSo now every time I need to remove minimum so I can use min-heap here of size ladders.\\n\\nLet\\'s code now\\n\\n# Code\\nJava []\\nclass Solution {\\n    public int furthestBuilding(int[] heights, int bricks, int ladders) {\\n        int n = heights.length;\\n        PriorityQueue pq = new PriorityQueue();\\n        for(int i=0;i 0) {\\n                if(pq.size() = diff) {\\n                        bricks -= diff;\\n                    } else {\\n                        int poll = pq.poll();\\n                        pq.add(diff);\\n                        bricks -= poll;\\n                    }\\n                    if(bricks \\nPython []\\nclass Solution:\\n    def furthestBuilding(self, heights: List[int], bricks: int, ladders: int) -> int:\\n        n = len(heights)\\n        pq = []\\n        for i in range(n-1):\\n            diff = heights[i+1] - heights[i]\\n            if diff > 0:\\n                if len(pq) = diff:\\n                        bricks -= diff\\n                    else:\\n                        poll = heappop(pq)\\n                        heappush(pq, diff)\\n                        bricks -= poll\\n                    if bricks \\nC++ []\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    int furthestBuilding(vector& heights, int bricks, int ladders) {\\n        int n = heights.size();\\n        priority_queue, greater> pq;\\n        for (int i = 0; i  0) {\\n                if (pq.size() = diff) {\\n                        bricks -= diff;\\n                    } else {\\n                        int poll = pq.top(); pq.pop();\\n                        pq.push(diff);\\n                        bricks -= poll;\\n                    }\\n                    if (bricks \\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: O(n*logk) where k = ladders because heap size would always be k.\\n\\n\\n- Space complexity: O(k)\\n\\n\\nRule#97 []\\nAs a Software Engineer, I work on three principles - \\n1.

So that your first element is always minimum. So if you want to insert new element either you can update it at first index and again sort it. But if you know binary search than you can find the position to insert in array and then shift elements so that it is still sorted. ( But I would recommend you read about priority queue, It\\'s not a rocket science. )\\n\\nSummary []\\n1. Before going for DP, try to think atleast from greedy persepective.\\n2. You can use min-heap of size k to always maintain the data having\\n   value more than m ( where m is minimum ). So your m would be the \\n   k largest element here. ( Try to read K largest or K smallest ).\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s all from my side ...\\n\\nNow I\\'ve one tip for you guys\\nRule#100 []\\nBe Calm and Crack Jokes in Tough Situations as well !!!\\n\\nIf you are software engineer, or in the road of becoming.\\nThere would be sometimes when something bad happens or some\\nbug that will ruin your whole day / week.\\n\\nBut Remember one thing no matter what happens, even if you lose\\nthe job or you done something wrong on production. \\nNot only you if your juniors do something terribly wrong. \\nFirst try to solve it asap and handle the sitation calmly.\\n\\nDon\\'t loose your humour in any situations.\\n\\n\\nIf you have come so far, Please upvote it !!!\\n\\n---\\n### Connect via\\n#### 1.

Given a binary tree and an integer target, we need to remove all the leaf nodes that have the value equal to target. If, after deletion, the parent nodes become leaves and also match the target, they should also be removed. The process continues until no more leaf nodes with the target value exist in the tree. How would you approach this problem?\\n\\nInterviewee: To start with, I would consider a brute-force approach. We can perform a depth-first traversal and, each time, check if a node is a leaf node and whether its value matches the target. If it does, we remove it. We will also need to check the parent nodes and continue this process until no nodes are left that meet the criteria.\\n\\nInterviewer: That sounds like a plan. Can you explain how you will remove a leaf node and also keep track of the parent nodes?\\n\\nInterviewee: In a brute-force approach, during each traversal we can:\\n1. Check if a node is a leaf and its value is equal to the target.\\n2. If it is, we set the reference from its parent to null.\\n3. Perform depth-first traversal recursively to cover all nodes.\\n4. Repeat the above process starting from the root until there are no more deletions needed.\\n\\n### Brute Force Solution: Time and Space Complexity\\n\\nInterviewer: That makes sense. What will be the time and space complexity for your approach?\\n\\nInterviewee: \\n- Time Complexity: Each pass of traversal through the tree will take \\(O(n)\\) time, where \\(n\\) is the number of nodes in the tree. In the worst case, we might need to pass through the tree multiple times, close to \\(n\\) times, making the worst-case time complexity \\(O(n^2)\\).\\n- Space Complexity: The recursion stack will potentially go as deep as the height of the tree, which in the worst case (skewed tree) could be \\(n\\). Hence, the worst-case space complexity is \\(O(n)\\).\\n\\n### Optimizing the Solution\\n\\nInterviewer: Can we optimize this approach further?\\n\\nInterviewee:\\nOne way to optimize is to handle the deletions in a single pass rather than multiple passes. We can modify our depth-first traversal to handle deletions seamlessly:\\n1. Traverse the tree using a post-order depth-first search.\\n2. At each node, first recursively process the left and right children.\\n3. After processing children, check if the node itself is now a leaf and needs to be deleted.\\n\\nThis way, each node is processed exactly once.\\n\\n#### Optimized Solution: Time and Space Complexity\\n\\nInterviewer: Great! What about the time and space complexity for this optimized approach?\\n\\nInterviewee: \\n- Time Complexity: Every node is visited exactly once, making the time complexity \\(O(n)\\).\\n- Space Complexity: The space complexity remains \\(O(h)\\), where \\(h\\) is the height of the tree. In the worst case, it\\'s \\(O(n)\\), but in balanced trees, it would be \\(O(\\log n)\\).\\n\\n### Drawing Representation\\n\\nHere\\'s a visual representation illustrating the deletion process:\\n\\n\\nInitial Tree:\\n        1\\n      /   \\\\\\n     2     3\\n    /     / \\\\\\n   2     2   4\\n   \\nStep-by-Step Deletion:\\n1. Traverse to [2 (leaf with value = 2)], delete.\\n        1\\n      /   \\\\\\n     2     3\\n    /     / \\\\\\n  null   2   4\\n\\n2. Now, [2 (leaf with value = 2)], delete.\\n        1\\n      /   \\\\\\n     2     3\\n    /     / \\\\\\n  null  null  4\\n\\n3. Finally, [2 (leaf with value = 2)], delete.\\n        1\\n      /    \\\\\\n  null     3\\n         /   \\\\\\n       null   4\\n\\nFinal Tree:\\n   1\\n    \\\\\\n     3\\n      \\\\\\n       4\\n\\n\\nGood illustration helps in visualizing the deletions happening step-by-step.\\n\\nInterviewer: Great job! This looks efficient, and your visual explanation clarifies the approach very well.\\nLet\\'s implement the optimized solution in each of the provided languages. We\\'ll use a post-order traversal approach to handle deletions in a single pass.\\n\\n## C++\\n\\ncpp\\n/**\\n * Definition for a binary tree node.\\n * struct TreeNode {\\n *     int val;\\n *     TreeNode *left;\\n *     TreeNode *right;\\n *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}\\n *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr, right(nullptr) {}\\n *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}\\n * };\\n */\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    TreeNode* removeLeafNodes(TreeNode* root, int target) {\\n        if (!root) return nullptr;\\n        root->left = removeLeafNodes(root->left, target);\\n        root->right = removeLeafNodes(root->right, target);\\n        if (!root->left && !root->right && root->val == target)\\n            return nullptr;\\n        return root;\\n    }\\n};\\n\\n\\n## Java\\n\\njava\\n/**\\n * Definition for a binary tree node.\\n * public class TreeNode {\\n *     int val;\\n *     TreeNode left;\\n *     TreeNode right;\\n *     TreeNode() {}\\n *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }\\n *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {\\n *         this.val = val;\\n *         this.left = left;\\n *         this.right = right;\\n *     }\\n * }\\n */\\nclass Solution {\\n    public TreeNode removeLeafNodes(TreeNode root, int target) {\\n        if (root == null) return null;\\n        root.left = removeLeafNodes(root.left, target);\\n        root.right = removeLeafNodes(root.right, target);\\n        if (root.left == null && root.right == null && root.val == target)\\n            return null;\\n        return root;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n\\n## Python\\n\\npython\\n# Definition for a binary tree node.\\n# class TreeNode(object):\\n#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\\n#         self.val = val\\n#         self.left = left\\n#         self.right = right\\n\\nclass Solution(object):\\n    def removeLeafNodes(self, root, target):\\n        \"\"\"\\n        :type root: TreeNode\\n        :type target: int\\n        :rtype: TreeNode\\n        \"\"\"\\n        if not root:\\n            return None\\n        root.left = self.removeLeafNodes(root.left, target)\\n        root.right = self.removeLeafNodes(root.right, target)\\n        if not root.left and not root.right and root.val == target:\\n            return None\\n        return root\\n\\n\\n## Python3\\n\\npython\\n# Definition for a binary tree node.\\n# class TreeNode:\\n#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\\n#         self.val = val\\n#         self.left = left\\n#         self.right = right\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    def removeLeafNodes(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], target: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:\\n        if not root:\\n            return None\\n        root.left = self.removeLeafNodes(root.left, target)\\n        root.right = self.removeLeafNodes(root.right, target)\\n        if not root.left and not root.right and root.val == target:\\n            return None\\n        return root\\n\\n\\n## C\\n\\nc\\n/**\\n * Definition for a binary tree node.\\n * struct TreeNode {\\n *     int val;\\n *     struct TreeNode *left;\\n *     struct TreeNode *right;\\n * };\\n */\\nstruct TreeNode* removeLeafNodes(struct TreeNode* root, int target) {\\n    if (!root) return NULL;\\n    root->left = removeLeafNodes(root->left, target);\\n    root->right = removeLeafNodes(root->right, target);\\n    if (!root->left && !root->right && root->val == target) {\\n        free(root);\\n        return NULL;\\n    }\\n    return root;\\n}\\n\\n\\n## C#\\n\\ncsharp\\n/**\\n * Definition for a binary tree node.\\n * public class TreeNode {\\n *     public int val;\\n *     public TreeNode left;\\n *     public TreeNode right;\\n *     public TreeNode(int val=0, TreeNode left=null, TreeNode right=null) {\\n *         this.val = val;\\n *         this.left = left;\\n *         this.right = right;\\n *     }\\n * }\\n */\\npublic class Solution {\\n    public TreeNode RemoveLeafNodes(TreeNode root, int target) {\\n        if (root == null) return null;\\n        root.left = RemoveLeafNodes(root.left, target);\\n        root.right = RemoveLeafNodes(root.right, target);\\n        if (root.left == null && root.right == null && root.val == target)\\n            return null;\\n        return root;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n\\n## JavaScript\\n\\njavascript\\n/**\\n * Definition for a binary tree node.\\n * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {\\n *     this.val = (val===undefined ?

Although in this blog It\\'s first and last time I\\'m\\nmentioning LIS.\\n\\n\\n### Youtube Solution ( In Hindi Language Only )\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EAv6OKEZSk&ab_channel=CSIITIAN\\n\\n## Common Sense\\nIn Each group atleast one element would be present, so for size 1 we can have n no. of groups.\\n\\nNow let\\'s make some sense, how would you add a number in the group\\nGroup: [1, 3, 6]\\nand you have 9, would you be able to add ?\\nOf Course not why because 9 would not be divisble by 6.\\n\\nWhat about 12 ? Yes you can add 12.\\n\\n## Observation to Add New Number\\nNow one more thing to observe here is If I just divide the newly (to be) added number by the maximum element of my group I can make sure the whole group is divided. ( Because the group\\'s LCM is the maximum number )\\n\\n### Can I add number less than the maximum number in group ?\\nWell yes ! Let\\'s see\\nGroup: [1, 4, 8]\\nand now can I add 2 here ? yes ! Now new Group would be [1, 2, 4, 8]\\n\\nSo I have to handle two things, \\n1. If the number is greater or equal to maximum of group, then it should be divisible by maximum.\\n2. If the number is less than maximum of group, it should divide all the group members.\\n\\nWe can see that in first point, It is much easy to add I just need to know maximum but in second point I need to traverse the whole group to be able to add new element.\\n\\n## What If Say, I Can handle both in First Point itself\\nPreviously we have seen two points by which we can add new number to a group.\\nBut What if I always make sure that I add new number using first point only. I mean what if I always make sure that the number I am adding is always greater than group ?\\n\\nTake a Pause and Think about it , How can we do it ?\\n\\nOkay, so basically I will sort the array to make sure the element which I am going to add is always greater.\\n\\nNow I don\\'t need to know the group.\\n\\nSo for current element, I can check all the previous and check divisibility and if it is divisble then it can be added to group so I will increase the group size by 1.\\n\\nNow I know the size, but here I also need to know the group element, So I also keep track of the element. So whenever I increase the group size I will add the previous element. So that I can backtrack the origin of the group. ( Group\\'s starting point would be marked as -1 )\\n\\n# Approach\\n\\n1. Sort the Array ( ascending order )\\n2. For Each Element traverse the previous element\\n3. If element is divisible by any previous element it means it can be part of that group by we also need to make sure it is part of the group with maximum size, So if we found any bigger group we will add it to that group\\n4. If we update the group size, it means we have added new element I will update my previous of the current element with group\\'s maximum till now ( before adding )\\n5. I will also track the index of the last element added in the biggest group\\n6.

There are exactly n coins in total throughout the whole tree. In one move, you can choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one to the other. A move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent. Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin.\\n\\nHere is an example:\\nplaintext\\nInput: root = [3,0,0]\\nOutput: 2\\nExplanation: From the root of the tree, we move one coin to its left child, and one coin to its right child.\\n\\n\\nDo you have any initial thoughts on how to approach this problem?\\n\\n#### Interviewee:\\nYes, I do. Initially, we can consider a brute-force approach to understand the nature of the problem. Later, we can look into optimizing it.\\n\\n### Brute Force Approach\\n\\n#### Interviewee:\\nLet\\'s start with the brute-force approach. In this problem, we need to ensure that every node ends up with exactly one coin. A simple, yet inefficient way to solve the problem would be to simulate the process by iterating multiple passes until every node is balanced.\\n\\n#### Steps:\\n1. For each node, check if it has more (or fewer) than one coin.\\n2. If a node has excess coins, try to move them to adjacent nodes.\\n3. Count every move.\\n4. Repeat the process until all nodes have exactly one coin.\\n\\n#### Interviewer:\\nWhat would the time and space complexity of this brute-force approach be?\\n\\n#### Interviewee:\\nThe brute-force approach would likely have a high time complexity because in the worst-case we might need to iteratively inspect each node and perform moves until all nodes are balanced. Specifically, the time complexity could be O(n^2) due to possibly rechecking nodes multiple times.\\n\\nThe space complexity would be O(n) since we need storage proportional to the number of nodes to keep track of the coins distribution. \\n\\n### Optimized Approach\\n\\n#### Interviewee:\\nTo optimize, we can use Depth-First Search (DFS) to compute a more efficient solution. The idea is to treat moving coins in the tree as a flow problem where coins are transferred within the constraints until the nodes are balanced.\\n\\n#### Optimized Steps:\\n1. Perform a DFS traversal of the tree.\\n2. For each node, calculate the excess or deficit coins after considering its sub-tree.\\n3. The total moves required will be the sum of absolute values of excess/deficit transferred to/from child nodes.\\n\\n#### Interviewer:\\nCan you explain this with a drawing?\\n\\n### Drawing Explanation\\n\\nLet\\'s use the example root = [3, 0, 0]:\\n\\n\\n    3\\n   / \\\\\\n  0   0\\n\\n\\n- Starting at the root (node 3), it has 2 excess coins to be distributed: 3 - 1 = 2.\\n- From node 3, it could move these 2 coins to its children (1 coin to each child).\\n\\n\\n    1\\n   / \\\\\\n  1   1\\n\\n\\nHere, we\\'ll need exactly 2 moves:\\n- 1 move to transfer a coin to the left child.\\n- 1 move to transfer a coin to the right child.\\n\\n#### Interviewer:\\nWhat are the time and space complexities for this optimized approach?\\n\\n#### Interviewee:\\nThe time complexity is O(n) since we perform a single DFS traversal through the tree, visiting each node exactly once.\\n\\nThe space complexity is O(h) where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursive call stack. In the worst case for a skewed tree, this can be O(n). For a balanced tree, it would be O(log n).\\n\\n#### Interviewer:\\nOkay, that sounds good. So, we can summarize that using a DFS traversal method is both time and space efficient for this problem.\\n\\nShall we move on to writing the actual code?\\n\\n#### Interviewee:\\nSure! Here\\'s a possible code implementation for the optimized approach:\\n\\npython\\nclass TreeNode:\\n    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\\n        self.val = val\\n        self.left = left\\n        self.right = right\\n\\nclass Solution:\\n    def distributeCoins(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:\\n        self.moves = 0\\n        \\n        def dfs(node):\\n            if not node:\\n                return 0\\n            \\n            left_excess = dfs(node.left)\\n            right_excess = dfs(node.right)\\n            \\n            self.moves += abs(left_excess) + abs(right_excess)\\n            \\n            return node.val + left_excess + right_excess - 1\\n        \\n        dfs(root)\\n        return self.moves\\n\\n\\nThis code uses a DFS method to calculate and move excess coins efficiently.\\nSure!

We began by understanding the nature of the problem and explored a potential brute-force approach. However, we quickly moved on to an optimized solution using Depth-First Search (DFS). This allowed us to efficiently compute the minimum moves required by taking advantage of recursive traversal and balancing excess coins at each subtree level.\\n\\nThe optimized solution demonstrated a significant improvement in both time complexity, which is linear O(n), as well as space complexity, which is dependent on the tree\\'s height O(h). We also implemented this solution in various programming languages, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the approach across different contexts.\\n\\n### Similar Questions:\\n\\n1. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum\\n   - Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum. The path may start and end at any node in the tree.\\n\\n2. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers\\n   - Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number. Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.\\n\\n3. Binary Tree Tilt\\n   - Given a binary tree, return the tilt of the whole tree.\\n   The tilt of a tree node is defined as the absolute difference between the sum of all left subtree node values and the sum of all right subtree node values. Null nodes are treated as sum 0.\\n\\n4. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree\\n   - Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer. Deserialization is the reverse process.\\n\\n5. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List\\n   - Given a binary tree, flatten it into a linked list in place. After flattening, the left of each node should point to null and the right should contain the next node of the pre-order traversal.\\n\\n6. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree\\n   - Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.\\n\\nThese problems, much like our main discussion topic, require deep traversal techniques and a solid understanding of tree data structures and recursion. Solving these problems will further strengthen your grasp on various binary tree-based algorithms."}]}

Given a 2D matrix grid of size \\( n x n \\), each cell either contains a thief (represented by 1) or is an empty cell (represented by 0). You start at cell (0, 0) and can move to any adjacent cell. The safeness factor of a path is the minimum Manhattan distance from any cell in the path to any thief in the grid. You need to return the maximum safeness factor of all paths leading to the bottom-right cell (n-1, n-1). \\n\\nInterviewee: Understood. To summarize, we need to find the safest path from the top-left to the bottom-right of the grid, where the safeness factor is defined as the shortest Manhattan distance to the nearest thief on that path, and we aim to maximize this minimum distance.\\n\\nInterviewer: Correct. Can you state your initial thoughts?\\n\\n### Initial Thoughts and Brute Force Approach\\n\\nInterviewee: For a brute force approach, I would consider all possible paths from (0, 0) to (n-1, n-1). For each path, we would calculate the minimum Manhattan distance to any thief and keep track of the maximum of these minimum distances. \\n\\nHowever, this would involve an exhaustive search of all possible paths, which is not feasible due to the exponential number of possible paths in the grid.\\n\\nInterviewer: Yes, the brute force approach would indeed be infeasible for large grids due to the combinatorial explosion. Let\\'s consider more efficient ways to solve the problem, both in terms of time and space complexity.\\n\\n### Time and Space Complexity of Brute Force\\n\\nInterviewee: The time complexity for the brute force approach would be O(2^(nn)), given that each cell can lead to many different paths. The space complexity would be O(nn) to store the grid and paths.\\n\\nInterviewer: Great. Let\\'s move to a more optimized solution. Can you think of any data structures or algorithms that could help improve efficiency?\\n\\n### Optimized Approach Using BFS and Distance Calculations\\n\\nInterviewee: A more efficient approach would be using Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the minimum distances from each cell to the nearest thief. We can start by identifying all the thieves\\' positions in the grid and perform a multi-source BFS to propagate the distances.\\n\\nInterviewer: That sounds promising. Can you explain how this works in detail?\\n\\nInterviewee: Sure:\\n\\n1. Multi-source BFS for Distance Calculation:\\n    - Initialize a distance grid dist of size \\( n \\times n \\) with infinity.\\n    - Collect all thief positions and initialize their distances to 0.\\n    - Run BFS from all these thief positions to calculate the minimum distance to any thief for all cells.\\n\\n2. Find the Maximum Safeness Path:\\n    - Use a priority queue (max-heap) to explore paths, prioritizing paths with higher safeness factors.\\n    - Start from the top-left corner, keep track of the maximum safeness factor on any path to each cell, and expand to adjacent cells.\\n    - Continue until reaching the bottom-right corner, and update the maximum safeness factor of any valid path found.\\n\\nOverall, the BFS for distance calculation runs in O(n^2) time, and finding the safeness path using a priority queue also runs in O(n^2 * log(n)).\\n\\n### Drawing and Explanation\\n\\nInterviewer: Let\\'s visualize this approach. Can you draw an example of how it works?\\n\\nInterviewee: Sure. Here\\'s a step-by-step representation:\\n\\n1. Grid Initialization and Multi-source BFS:\\n    \\n    Initial grid:\\n    1 0 0\\n    0 0 0\\n    0 0 1\\n\\n\\n2. Distance Calculation (Multi-source BFS):\\n    \\n    Distance grid after BFS:\\n    0 1 2\\n    1 2 1\\n    2 1 0\\n\\n\\n3. Safeness Path Calculation:\\n    - Start at (0,0) with safeness factor 0. Push (0,0,0) into max-heap.\\n    - Expand to adjacent cells, always choosing maximum safeness paths.\\n    - Final path with maximum safeness factor:\\n    \\n    Maximum safeness path:\\n    0 1 2\\n    1 2 1\\n    x x 0  (path marked with x\\'s)\\n\\n\\nThe safest path strategy in this example would move along the boundaries to avoid close contact with thieves, maximizing the minimum distance to a thief.\\n\\nInterviewer: Excellent explanation and visualization! This approach is efficient and well-thought-out. Great job!Sure! Let\\'s write the optimized solution in C++, Java, and Python. We\\'ll follow the described approach: first calculating the minimum distances from any cell to the nearest thief using multi-source BFS, then determining the maximum safeness factor using a priority queue for path exploration.\\n\\n### C++ Code\\n\\ncpp\\nclass Solution {\\npublic:\\n    vector> directions = {{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}};\\n\\n    int maximumSafenessFactor(vector>& grid) {\\n        int n = grid.size();\\n        vector> dist(n, vector(n, INT_MAX));\\n        queue> q;\\n\\n        // Initialize all thief positions\\n        for (int r = 0; r = 0 && nr = 0 && nc >> pq;\\n        pq.push({dist[0][0], {0, 0}});\\n        vector> maxSafeness(n, vector(n, -1));\\n        maxSafeness[0][0] = dist[0][0];\\n\\n        while (!pq.empty()) {\\n            auto [d, pos] = pq.top();\\n            pq.pop();\\n            int r = pos.first, c = pos.second;\\n            if (r == n - 1 && c == n - 1) return d;  // Reached bottom-right corner\\n\\n            for (auto& dir : directions) {\\n                int nr = r + dir[0], nc = c + dir[1];\\n                if (nr >= 0 && nr = 0 && nc  maxSafeness[nr][nc]) {\\n                        maxSafeness[nr][nc] = newSafe;\\n                        pq.push({newSafe, {nr, nc}});\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        return -1;  // In case there\\'s no valid path\\n    }\\n};\\n\\n\\n### Java Code\\n\\njava\\nclass Solution {\\n\\n    static int[][] directions = {{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}};\\n\\n    public int maximumSafenessFactor(List> grid) {\\n        int n = grid.size();\\n        int[][] dist = new int[n][n];\\n        for (int[] row : dist) Arrays.fill(row, Integer.MAX_VALUE);\\n        Queue q = new LinkedList<>();\\n\\n        // Initialize all thief positions\\n        for (int r = 0; r = 0 && nr = 0 && nc  pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b[0] - a[0]);\\n        pq.offer(new int[]{dist[0][0], 0, 0});\\n        int[][] maxSafeness = new int[n][n];\\n        for (int[] row : maxSafeness) Arrays.fill(row, -1);\\n        maxSafeness[0][0] = dist[0][0];\\n\\n        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {\\n            int[] cell = pq.poll();\\n            int d = cell[0], r = cell[1], c = cell[2];\\n            if (r == n - 1 && c == n - 1) return d;\\n\\n            for (int[] dir : directions) {\\n                int nr = r + dir[0], nc = c + dir[1];\\n                if (nr >= 0 && nr = 0 && nc  maxSafeness[nr][nc]) {\\n                        maxSafeness[nr][nc] = newSafe;\\n                        pq.offer(new int[]{newSafe, nr, nc});\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        return -1;  // In case there\\'s no valid path        \\n    }\\n}\\n\\n\\n### Python Code\\n\\npython\\nclass Solution:\\n    def maximumSafenessFactor(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:\\n        n = len(grid)\\n        directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]\\n        dist = [[float(\\'inf\\')] * n for _ in range(n)]\\n        q = deque()\\n\\n        # Initialize all thief positions\\n        for r in range(n):\\n            for c in range(n):\\n                if grid[r][c] == 1:\\n                    q.append((r, c))\\n                    dist[r][c] = 0\\n\\n        # Multi-source BFS to calculate minimum distance to any thief\\n        while q:\\n            r, c = q.popleft()\\n            for dr, dc in directions:\\n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\\n                if 0  max_safeness[nr][nc]:\\n                        max_safeness[nr][nc] = new_safe\\n                        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-new_safe, nr, nc))\\n\\n        return -1  # In case there\\'s no valid path\\n\\n\\n### Complexity Analysis\\n\\n- Time Complexity:\\n  - BFS: O(n^2) for computing distances since each cell and its neighbors are processed once.\\n  - Path Finding Using Priority Queue: O(n^2 * log(n)) as each cell is pushed and popped from the heap, and each operation is logarithmic in time complexity.\\n\\n- Space Complexity:\\n  - BFS: O(n^2) to store the distances and queue for processing cells.\\n  - Priority Queue: O(n^2) to manage the cells being processed, and the duplicate queue for distances.\\n\\nThese complexities are efficient and acceptable for the given problem constraints (1 LeetCode 64: Minimum Path Sum\\n   - Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from the top-left to the bottom-right that minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.\\n\\n2.
